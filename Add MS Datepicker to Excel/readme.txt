This script will install datepicker for excel.
Of note, this will only work for 32 bit installations of excel, this should not be attempted for 64 bit installations of excel as this may cause problems.
To check, open excel:
File -> Acount -> About Excel

It's written at the top, mine reads:
"Microsoft® Excel® for Microsoft 365 MSO (16.0.13929.20206) 32-bit "

This script requires administrator privleges.
